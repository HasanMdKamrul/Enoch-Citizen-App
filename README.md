# What features it offers?

- In this app I have build dynamic cards.
- Not only the cards but also every component inside the card is re-usable.
- I have used different countdown timmer with different time and date.
- Each timmer is functional, you can visualise them.
- I have added a modal where you can provide your biding price and it updates instantly. The modal is a generic re-usable modal component which can be used in any other project.
- You can't provide a price less than the current price.
- This app will warn you with toast and it will not update the price.
- I have also added price reduction feature, you specify your discount percentage and it will reduce the price automatically.
- Every data is dynamic, later you can convert them to API and it will work perfectly. By using few lines of code.
